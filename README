WebGL-Lesson-Work
 -F1LT3R

Just a quick repository containing my lesson work as I follow:
http://learningwebgl.com/lessons

There's nothing new or special to see here. However, I have attempted to use
JavaScript best practices in my code, whereas the original lessons use
depricated methods such as "body.onload".
